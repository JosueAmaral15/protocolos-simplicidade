## 🎯 Core Philosophy

> "There will always be complex tasks to do, but also those that are more difficult and those that are easier. **I want you to always start with the easier ones**."

**Principle**: From simple to complex, incremental, professional, and complete.

---

## ⚠️ Golden Rule: Absolute Priority for Workspace Errors

> **CRITICAL**: Before implementing new features or continuing with tasks, **all workspace errors must be fixed**.

### 🚨 Types of Errors That Block Development

Consider the existence of errors in the workspace (visible in the IDE's "Problems" tab) as **undesirable and blocking**. If any of the following types of errors occur, **fixing them is an absolute priority** before continuing:

1. **❌ Syntax Issues**
   - Code parsing errors
   - Unclosed parentheses, braces, or brackets
   - Incorrect indentation (Python)
   - Missing semicolons (JavaScript, C, Java)

2. **❌ Code Inconsistencies**
   - Variables declared but not used
   - Unused or missing imports
   - Dead code (unreachable code)
   - Type mismatches (TypeScript, Python with type hints)

3. **❌ Unexpected Omissions**
   - Functions declared but not implemented
   - Missing required parameters
   - Missing return statements when expected
   - Missing mandatory documentation

4. **❌ Incorrect Facts**
   - References to non-existent variables
   - Function calls with wrong number of arguments
   - Access to non-existent properties
   - Imports of non-existent modules

5. **❌ Ambiguities**
   - Type checking warnings
   - Possible null/undefined references
   - Variable shadowing
   - Dangerous implicit type conversions

6. **❌ Missing Files**
   - Dependencies not installed
   - Imported modules not found
   - Missing configuration files
   - Referenced but non-existent assets

7. **❌ Execution Failures**
   - Build failures
   - Compilation errors
   - Failing tests
   - Linter errors (when configured)

### ✅ When You Can Continue

**ONLY** continue with development of new features when:

- ✅ **Zero errors** in the workspace "Problems" tab
- ✅ **All builds** complete successfully
- ✅ **All tests** pass (if they already exist)
- ✅ **Linter/formatter** doesn't report critical errors
- ✅ **Type checker** doesn't report errors (if applicable)

### 📋 Checklist Before Each Task

```markdown
Before starting any new task:

[ ] Check IDE "Problems" tab (0 errors)
[ ] Run project build (success)
[ ] Run existing tests (all passing)
[ ] Run linter/formatter (no critical errors)
[ ] Verify imports and dependencies (all resolved)
[ ] Confirm code is in clean state (committable)
```

### ⏱️ Estimated Time for Fixing

- **Syntax Errors**: ~2-5 minutes per error
- **Imports/Dependencies**: ~5-10 minutes
- **Type Errors**: ~5-15 minutes per error
- **Failing Tests**: ~10-30 minutes (depends on complexity)

**Rule of Thumb**: If you have >10 errors in the workspace, **dedicate 1-2 hours** to clean everything before proceeding.

### 🎯 Rationale

**Why is this rule critical?**

1. **Cascade Prevention**: One uncorrected error can generate 10 new errors
2. **Code Quality**: Code with errors = immediate technical debt
3. **Reliability**: New features on top of broken code = guaranteed bugs
4. **Productivity**: Fixing old + new errors is more time-consuming than fixing only old ones
5. **Professionalism**: Clean, error-free code is a minimum requirement

**Message**: 
> "Until the errors are resolved, tasks and features cannot continue being implemented."

## 🎯 When to Use Simplicity 1?

### ✅ Use Simplicity 1 IF:
- ✅ **Solo** project or small team (1-3 devs)
- ✅ **Simple to medium** features
- ✅ **Rapid prototyping** or POC
- ✅ First development of a functionality
- ✅ **Speed** is more important than perfection
- ✅ **Non-critical internal** projects
- ✅ **Learning** new technologies or experimenting
- ✅ **Single-use** scripts or temporary tools

### ❌ DO NOT use Simplicity 1 IF:
- ❌ **Critical production** application → Use **Simplicity 3** (solo) or **Simplicity 2** (team)
- ❌ System with **security requirements** (sensitive data, GDPR) → Use **Simplicity 3**
- ❌ **High impact/risk** features → Use **Simplicity 2** or **3**
- ❌ **Large teams** (>5 devs) → Use **Simplicity 2**
- ❌ **Public** library/API → Use **Simplicity 2**
- ❌ System with critical **performance requirements** → Use **Simplicity 2** or **3**

### 🔄 When to Migrate to Other Protocols?
- **→ Simplicity 3**: When an internal project goes into production with real users
- **→ Simplicity 2**: When the team grows to 3+ developers

**Rationale**: Simplicity 1 is **agile and pragmatic** for rapid development, but **lacks critical security layers for production** (security checklist, CI/CD, rollback plans). It's perfect for **learning, prototyping, and iterating quickly**, but should be **upgraded** when the code goes to production or the team grows.

## 📋 Protocol Backbone (13 Steps)

**Executive Summary**:
1. 📚 Read the documentation
2. ✅ Choose the simplest tasks
3. ❓ Ask questions until 100% of doubts are clarified
4. 🔍 Analyze and study the project
5. 🎯 Do sprints for the simplest tasks
6. 💻 Implement with professional architecture (GoF + GRASP)
7. ⌨️ **Verify CLI Implementation + Code Review (9 criteria)**
8. 🖥️ **Verify GUI Implementation + Code Review (9 criteria)**
9. 🔗 **Verify Integration with Main Program**
🔟 🧪 Run tests (100% coverage)
1️⃣1️⃣ 🧹 Organize root folder
1️⃣2️⃣ 📝 Fill in documentation
1️⃣3️⃣ 🚀 Commit and push

### 1️⃣ **Read the Documentation**
- Consult `TASKS.md` (or equivalent file defined by the user) to see pending tasks
- Consult `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` to understand the project context
- Review previous specifications (`v2.9.X-SPECIFICATIONS.md`)
- Understand existing dependencies and architecture
- Check examples in `tests/files/` when applicable

**📋 About the Task File**:

The `TASKS.md` file is the **default file** for managing project tasks, but you can use any ASCII format file (`.txt`, `.md`, etc.) according to your preference.

**Task File Requirements**:
- ✅ **ASCII format mandatory**: `.md`, `.txt` or similar (readable as plain text)
- ❌ **NOT accepted**: `.docx`, `.pdf`, or binary formats
- 📍 **Location**: Project root or in `docs/` (e.g., `TASKS.md`, `TODO.md`, `requirements.md`)
- 🔄 **Alternative**: If you prefer another name/location, specify at project start

**If no task file exists**:
1. AI should ask the user: "Which file do you use to manage tasks?"
2. If none exists, suggest creating the default `TASKS.md`
3. Confirm file location and name with the user

**Why?**: Avoid rework and ensure consistency with existing code. The task file centralizes project planning and progress.

---

### 2️⃣ **Choose the Simplest Tasks**
- **Golden Rule**: Always start with the tasks **easiest to implement**
- Even in a list of complex tasks, **there are always some simpler than others**
- Proportionality: balance simplicity vs. impact

**Simplicity Criteria**:
- ✅ Fewer dependencies
- ✅ Well-defined and clear scope
- ✅ Fewer files to modify
- ✅ Lower risk of breaking existing functionalities
- ✅ Can be tested in isolation

**Real Example**:
```
List of remaining complex tasks:
[ ] Complex Feature Example (VERY COMPLEX - 50h)
[ ] Semantic AI Search (COMPLEX - 20h)
[ ] Tooltip preview on hover (SIMPLE - 30min) ✅ START HERE!
```

---

### 3️⃣ **Ask More and More Questions to the Programmer**
- **CRITICAL**: Never assume or guess requirements
- Ask **all necessary questions** until **100% of doubts** are clarified
- Validate understanding before starting implementation
- 🤖 **[NEW v1.9]** The AI **CAN and IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** to provide **suggestions and hunches** for answers to each question (optional, but encouraged)

**Recommended Question Format with Suggestions**:
```
❓ Question: "How should it behave when [scenario X]?"
💡 AI Suggestion: "Based on existing code, I suggest [option A] because [reason Y]."
Options: A) [option A] | B) [option B] | C) [option C]
```

**Why AI Suggestions Are Important**:
- ✅ Accelerates decisions when the programmer is undecided
- ✅ AI has context of existing code and can suggest consistent patterns
- ✅ Reduces programmer's cognitive load (they just validate, don't create from scratch)
- ✅ Maintains quality: AI suggests based on good practices already implemented

**Question Categories**:
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - "How should it behave when [scenario X]?"
   - "What happens if the user [action Y]?"
   - "What is the priority between [option A] and [option B]?"

2. **Technical Requirements**:
   - "Should I use [library X] or build from scratch?"
   - "What is the expected output format?"
   - "Are there any performance restrictions?"

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - "What if the file is empty?"
   - "What if there are special characters?"
   - "How to handle None/null values?"

4. **Integration**:
   - "Does it need to integrate with [existing module]?"
   - "Should I maintain compatibility with [previous version]?"
   - "Where should the results be saved?"

5. **Understanding Validation**:
   - "I understand you want [X]. Is that correct?"
   - "My proposed solution is [Y]. Does it make sense?"
   - "Can I start or did I forget something?"

**Example of Requirements Validation**:
```
❓ "How many characters/elements should be processed? (default: 30?)"
✅ Answer: "Default can be 30 characters"

❓ "Should text normalization be applied (remove accents, convert case)?"
✅ Answer: "Yes, they should be normalized"

❓ "How to resolve conflicts when there are duplicates?"
✅ Answer: "Use specific priority criteria (e.g., oldest wins)"
```

**Why?**: Saves time, avoids rework, ensures the solution meets exactly what was requested.

---

### 4️⃣ **Analyze and Study the Project**
- **CRITICAL**: After clarifying all doubts, **study the code before implementing**
- Read relevant documentation (README, docs/, code comments)
- Understand existing architecture and patterns used
- Check necessary dependencies and imports
- Identify reusable functions/classes

**Analysis Checklist**:
1. **Documentation Reading**:
   - `docs/` - General project context and specifications
   - Design and architecture documents
   - `README.md` - Overview and usage instructions
   - Docstrings of related modules

2. **Existing Code Analysis**:
   - Find modules similar to what will be implemented
   - Identify design patterns already used (GoF, GRASP)
   - Check naming conventions and structure
   - Locate reusable helper functions

3. **Dependency Mapping**:
   - Which modules need to be imported?
   - Are there name or version conflicts?
   - Which base classes or mixins should be inherited?
   - Where should new files be created?

4. **Compatibility Validation**:
   - Will the solution break existing code?
   - Is it necessary to refactor anything before implementing?
   - Are there tests that need to be updated?
   - Will the public API be maintained?

**Why?**: Avoid refactoring, save time, ensure code consistent with the existing base.

**Example of Existing Code Analysis**:
```
✅ Analyzed: Similar existing implementations in the project
✅ Identified: Used patterns of base classes and mixins
✅ Verified: Reusable UI widgets and components
✅ Studied: How other modules solve similar problems
✅ Located: Where to add new imports in the main code
✅ Confirmed: Integration structure with existing system
→ Result: Faster and more consistent implementation (60% savings)
```

**Why?**: Avoid refactoring, save time, ensure code consistent with the existing base.

---

### 5️⃣ **Do Sprints for the Simplest Tasks**
- Group 2-4 related tasks into a sprint
- Estimate total time: **maximum 3-4 hours** per sprint
- Maintain focus: **one sprint = one incremental version**

**Sprint Structure**:
```
Sprint vX.Y.Z (Feature Example):
├── Task: Feature Implementation (3h estimated)
│   ├── Subtask 1: Ask questions to the programmer (15min)
│   ├── Subtask 2: Implement main helper function (45min)
│   ├── Subtask 3: Implement processing function (45min)
│   ├── Subtask 4: Integration with existing code (30min)
│   ├── Subtask 5: Unit tests (60min)
│   └── Subtask 6: Documentation (30min)
└── Total: 3h45min ✅
```

---

### 6️⃣ **Implement from Simple to Complex with Professional Architecture**
- **Within each task**, start with the easiest part
- Build incrementally: helper function → main function → integration
- Test each part before moving on

**Implementation Order**:
1. **Helper functions** (e.g., `extract_all_keys_from_obj()`)
2. **Main functions** (e.g., `build_substitution_map_by_value()`)
3. **Integration** (e.g., update `cli_dedupe()`)
4. **GUI/UX** (if applicable)
5. **Optimizations** (last step)

**Architectural Principles (Mandatory)**:

#### 🔄 **Code Reuse with Modules**
- Create separate modules for each responsibility
- Avoid duplication (DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Generic functions reusable in multiple contexts

**Example**:
```python
# ✅ GOOD: Reusable module
# src/utils/file_utils.py
def read_file_safe(path: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """Function reused in 10+ places"""
    try:
        with open(path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            return f.read()
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error reading {path}: {e}")
        return None

# ❌ BAD: Duplicate code in each module
# (repeats try/except 20 times)
```

#### 📦 **Hierarchies and Encapsulation**
- Use classes when there is shared state
- Encapsulate private attributes (`_attribute`)
- Expose only necessary public interface

**Example**:
```python
# ✅ GOOD: Proper encapsulation
class ReferenceUpdater:
    def __init__(self, project_dir: str):
        self._project_dir = project_dir
        self._substitutions = {}
    
    def update_references(self) -> Dict[str, int]:
        """Clear public interface"""
        self._scan_files()  # Private method
        self._build_map()   # Private method
        return self._apply_changes()

# ❌ BAD: Everything exposed, no structure
def do_everything(dir, old, new, backup, ext):
    # 200 lines without organization
```

#### 🎯 **High Cohesion and Low Coupling**
- **High Cohesion**: Each module/class has a single clear responsibility
- **Low Coupling**: Independent modules, communication via interfaces

**Example**:
```python
# ✅ HIGH COHESION: Each class does ONE thing
class KeyExtractor:
    """Only extracts keys from structures"""
    def extract(self, data) -> Dict[str, str]: ...

class SubstitutionMapBuilder:
    """Only builds substitution map"""
    def build(self, old, new) -> Dict[str, str]: ...

class FileUpdater:
    """Only updates files"""
    def update(self, files, map) -> int: ...

# ✅ LOW COUPLING: Communication via interfaces
class ReferenceUpdater:
    def __init__(self, extractor: KeyExtractor, builder: SubstitutionMapBuilder):
        self._extractor = extractor  # Dependency injection
        self._builder = builder

# ❌ BAD: Low cohesion, high coupling
class EverythingManager:
    def do_all(self):
        # Does extraction + build + update + logging + GUI
        # Imports 20 different modules
        # Impossible to test in isolation
```

#### 🏗️ **GoF (Gang of Four) Patterns**
Apply design patterns when appropriate:

1. **Strategy Pattern** (algorithm choice at runtime):
```python
class CaseConverter:
    def __init__(self, strategy: CaseStrategy):
        self._strategy = strategy
    
    def convert(self, text: str) -> str:
        return self._strategy.apply(text)

class CamelCaseStrategy(CaseStrategy):
    def apply(self, text: str) -> str: ...

class SnakeCaseStrategy(CaseStrategy):
    def apply(self, text: str) -> str: ...
```

2. **Factory Pattern** (complex object creation):
```python
class ProcessorFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create(type: str) -> Processor:
        if type == "type_a":
            return ProcessorA()
        elif type == "type_b":
            return ProcessorB()
```

3. **Observer Pattern** (event notification):
```python
class ProcessingModal(QDialog):
    cancel_requested = Signal()  # Observer pattern
    
    def _on_cancel_clicked(self):
        self.cancel_requested.emit()  # Notifies observers
```

4. **Command Pattern** (undo/redo):
```python
class ReplaceCommand:
    def __init__(self, file: str, old: str, new: str):
        self._file = file
        self._old = old
        self._new = new
    
    def execute(self): ...
    def undo(self): ...
```

#### 🎨 **GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns)**

1. **Information Expert**: Assign responsibility to the one who has the information
```python
# ✅ GOOD: Class has the information, so it has the method
class DataStore:
    def __init__(self, data: dict):
        self._data = data
    
    def get_value(self, key_path: str) -> Optional[str]:
        """Class knows its structure"""
        return self._navigate_path(key_path)

# ❌ BAD: External class manipulates internal structure
def get_value_from_data(data_store, key_path):
    # Direct access to the internal dictionary structure
```

2. **Creator**: Class A creates B if A contains/aggregates B
```python
# ✅ GOOD: RewriterDock creates its own widgets
class ComponentB(BaseDock):
    def __init__(self):
        self._create_widgets()  # Creator pattern
        self._setup_layout()
    
    def _create_widgets(self):
        self.ed_input = QLineEdit()  # Creates its children
        self.btn_process = QPushButton()
```

3. **Controller**: Delegate system operations to a controller
```python
# ✅ GOOD: Controller coordinates operations
class RewriterController:
    def process_file(self, path: str):
        data = self._reader.read(path)
        processed = self._processor.process(data)
        self._writer.write(path, processed)

# ❌ BAD: GUI does everything directly
class RewriterDock:
    def on_button_click(self):
        # 50 lines of business logic in the GUI
```

4. **Low Coupling**: Minimize dependencies
```python
# ✅ GOOD: Generic interface
def update_references(updater: ReferenceUpdater):
    """Accepts any updater that implements the interface"""
    updater.update()

# ❌ BAD: Concrete dependency
def update_references(file_path: str, backup: bool, ext: list):
    """Many parameters, high coupling"""
```

5. **High Cohesion**: One class, one responsibility
```python
# ✅ GOOD: High cohesion
class FileReader:
    """Only reads files"""
    def read(self, path: str) -> str: ...

class DataValidator:
    """Only validates data"""
    def validate(self, data: dict) -> bool: ...

# ❌ BAD: Low cohesion
class FileManager:
    def read(self): ...
    def write(self): ...
    def validate(self): ...
    def send_email(self): ...  # ?!
```

**Anti-pattern** ❌:
```python
# DO NOT do everything at once:
def complex_function_with_everything():
    # 500 lines of code
    # Multiple responsibilities
    # Difficult to test
    # High coupling
    # No reuse
```

**Correct Pattern** ✅:
```python
# Module: src/processor/extractor.py
class DataExtractor:
    """High cohesion: only extracts data"""
    def extract_from_source(self, data) -> Dict[str, str]:
        return self._recurse(data, prefix='item')

# Module: src/processor/transformer.py
class DataTransformer:
    """High cohesion: only transforms data"""
    def transform(self, old, new) -> Dict[str, str]:
        return self._match_values(old, new)

# Module: src/processor/updater.py
class DataUpdater:
    """Low coupling: uses interfaces"""
    def __init__(self, extractor: DataExtractor, transformer: DataTransformer):
        self._extractor = extractor  # Dependency injection
        self._transformer = transformer
    
    def update_project(self, dir: str) -> Dict[str, int]:
        """Coordinates but doesn't implement everything"""
        old = self._extractor.extract(self._read_old())
        new = self._extractor.extract(self._read_new())
        mapping = self._transformer.transform(old, new)
        return self._apply_to_files(dir, mapping)
```

### 7️⃣ **Verify CLI Implementation + Code Review**
- **CRITICAL**: Verify that the new functionality is available via **CLI (Command Line Interface)**
- **IMPORTANT**: During verification, apply the **9 Quality Criteria** to the CLI code
- It's not enough to implement GUI, important functionalities must have a **CLI interface** for automation
- Check subcommands, arguments, help text, integration, and code quality

**CLI Implementation Checklist**:

1. **Correct Import in Main File**:
   ```python
   # ✅ Verify if module was imported
   from .modules import (
       ModuleA, ModuleB, ModuleC,
       ModuleD, ModuleE, ModuleF,
       ModuleG, ModuleH, NewModule  # ← NEW module should be here
   )
   ```

2. **Export in Module's __init__.py**:
   ```python
   # src/modules/__init__.py
   from .new_module import NewModule
   
   __all__ = [
       'ModuleA', 'ModuleB', 'ModuleC',
       'ModuleD', 'ModuleE', 'ModuleF',
       'ModuleG', 'ModuleH', 'NewModule'  # ← NEW module exported
   ]
   ```

3. **Interface/Menu Item Created and Connected**:
   ```python
   # In _build_interface() or similar
   menu = self.create_menu("Tools")
   
   # Create action
   self.action_new_feature = Action("New Feature", self)
   
   # Add to menu/interface
   menu.add_action(self.action_new_feature)
   
   # Connect signal
   self.action_new_feature.triggered.connect(lambda: self.new_module.execute())
   ```

4. **Dock Initialized in __init__() or setup method**:
   ```python
   # In __init__() of MainWindow
   def __init__(self):
       super().__init__()
       # ... other docks ...
       self._open_new_component()  # ← Initialize dock
   
   def _open_new_component(self):
       self.dock_new_component = NewComponent(self)
       self.dock_new_component.open_in_other_component_requested.connect(self._load_data_from_source)
       self.addDockWidget(Qt.RightDockWidgetArea, self.dock_new_component)
       self.dock_new_component.hide()
   ```

5. **Signals Connected** (if applicable):
   ```python
   # Connect custom signals
   self.dock_new_component.open_in_other_component_requested.connect(self._load_data_from_source)
   
   def _load_data_from_source(self, data_str: str):
       """Callback to open DATA in editor"""
       if not hasattr(self, 'component_viewer'):
           self._open_component()
       self.component_viewer.load_data_string(data_str)
       self.component_viewer.show()
   ```

6. **i18n Translations Added**:
   ```data
   // src/i18n/en.data
   {
     "menu.tools.text_to_data": "Text to DATA Converter"
   }
   
   // src/i18n/pt_BR.data
   {
     "menu.tools.text_to_data": "Conversor de Texto para DATA"
   }
   ```

**Integration Test Checklist**:
- ✅ **Accessible menu**: Verify if item appears in the Tools menu
- ✅ **Dock opens**: Clicking the menu should open the dock correctly
- ✅ **Basic functionality**: Test simple conversion
- ✅ **Signals work**: Test integration with other components (e.g., Open in Editor)
- ✅ **No console errors**: There should be no ImportError, AttributeError, etc.
- ✅ **Translation working**: Menu in PT-BR should show translated text

**Real Example (Task Example - Text to DATA Converter)**:
```python
✅ Import: from .gui import NewComponent
✅ Export: __all__ = [..., 'NewComponent']
✅ Menu: self.act_open_new_component = QAction(tr("menu.tools.text_to_data"), self)
✅ Init: self._open_new_component() called in __init__()
✅ Signal: open_in_other_component_requested.connect(self._load_data_from_source)
✅ i18n: EN "Text to DATA Converter", PT-BR "Conversor de Texto para DATA"
✅ Test: Menu opens dock, conversion works, signal to editor OK
```

**Questions to Validate Integration**:
1. ❓ "Is the new module imported in the main file (app.py)?"
2. ❓ "Is the module exported in the folder's __init__.py?"
3. ❓ "Is there a menu item to access the functionality?"
4. ❓ "Is the menu item connected to the correct method?"
5. ❓ "Is the dock/component initialized at application startup?"
6. ❓ "Are custom signals connected?"
7. ❓ "Are translations added (EN and PT-BR)?"
8. ❓ "Is the functionality accessible without errors?"

**Why?**: Ensure that the implemented code is **actually usable** by the end-user, not just "works in isolation".

### 8️⃣ **Verify GUI Implementation + Code Review**
- **CRITICAL**: Verify that the components are **integrated into the main program** and accessible
- **IMPORTANT**: During verification, apply the **9 Quality Criteria** to the GUI code
- It's not enough to implement the module/dock, it needs to be **accessible and functional** in the app
- Check menu, imports, initialization, connections, and code quality

**Part A - Functional GUI Verification (Integration)**:

1. **Correct Import in app.py**:
   ```python
   # ✅ Verify if module was imported
   from .gui import (
       ComponentJ, ComponentK, ComponentI,
       ComponentC, ComponentD, ComponentA,
       ComponentB, ComponentF, ComponentG, ComponentH,
       ComponentE, NewComponent  # ← NEW module should be here
   )
   ```

2. **Export in Module's __init__.py**:
   ```python
   # src/gui/__init__.py
   from .text_to_data_dock import NewComponent
   
   __all__ = [
       'ComponentJ', 'ComponentK', 'ComponentI',
       'ComponentC', 'ComponentD', 'ComponentA',
       'ComponentB', 'ComponentF', 'ComponentG', 'ComponentH',
       'ComponentE', 'NewComponent'  # ← NEW module exported
   ]
   ```

3. **Menu Item Created and Connected**:
   ```python
   # In _build_menu() or similar
   m_tools = bar.addMenu(tr("menu.tools"))
   
   # Create QAction
   self.act_open_new_component = QAction(tr("menu.tools.text_to_data"), self)
   
   # Add to menu
   m_tools.addAction(self.act_open_new_component)
   
   # Connect signal
   self.act_open_new_component.triggered.connect(lambda: self.dock_new_component.show())
   ```

4. **Dock Initialized in __init__() or setup method**:
   ```python
   # In __init__() of MainWindow
   def __init__(self):
       super().__init__()
       # ... other docks ...
       self._open_new_component()  # ← Initialize dock
   
   def _open_new_component(self):
       self.dock_new_component = NewComponent(self)
       self.dock_new_component.open_in_other_component_requested.connect(self._load_data_from_source)
       self.addDockWidget(Qt.RightDockWidgetArea, self.dock_new_component)
       self.dock_new_component.hide()
   ```

5. **Signals Connected** (if applicable):
   ```python
   # Connect custom signals
   self.dock_new_component.open_in_other_component_requested.connect(self._load_data_from_source)
   
   def _load_data_from_source(self, data_str: str):
       """Callback to open DATA in editor"""
       if not hasattr(self, 'component_viewer'):
           self._open_component()
       self.component_viewer.load_data_string(data_str)
       self.component_viewer.show()
   ```

6. **i18n Translations Added**:
   ```data
   // src/i18n/en.data
   {
     "menu.tools.text_to_data": "Text to DATA Converter"
   }
   
   // src/i18n/pt_BR.data
   {
     "menu.tools.text_to_data": "Conversor de Texto para DATA"
   }
   ```

**GUI Integration Test Checklist**:
- ✅ **Accessible menu**: Verify if item appears in the Tools menu
- ✅ **Dock opens**: Clicking the menu should open the dock correctly
- ✅ **Basic functionality**: Test simple conversion
- ✅ **Signals work**: Test integration with other components (e.g., Open in Editor)
- ✅ **No console errors**: There should be no ImportError, AttributeError, etc.
- ✅ **Translation working**: Menu in PT-BR should show translated text

**Part B - GUI Code Quality Review (9 Criteria)**:

During GUI verification, simultaneously apply the following criteria:

1. **❌ Omission** - Verify if GUI is complete:
   - [ ] All necessary widgets/controls implemented?
   - [ ] Error handling in handlers (e.g., FileNotFoundError)?
   - [ ] Resource cleanup (close files, disconnect signals)?
   - [ ] Visual feedback for long operations (QProgressBar, busy cursor)?

2. **🤔 Ambiguity** - GUI should be clear:
   - [ ] Descriptive and clear labels?
   - [ ] Informative tooltips on controls?
   - [ ] Descriptive error messages (QMessageBox)?
   - [ ] Intuitive method names (_on_button_clicked vs _handle)?

3. **❗ Incorrect Fact** - Correct GUI logic:
   - [ ] Signals connected to correct slots?
   - [ ] Correct layouts (QVBoxLayout, QHBoxLayout, QSplitter)?
   
- [ ] Enable/disable controls according to state?
   - [ ] Correct input validation (QValidator)?

4. **♻️ Redundancy** - Avoid repetition in GUI:
   - [ ] Widgets created only once?
   - [ ] Validations centralized (not duplicated)?
   - [ ] Initialization code not repeated?

5. **⚠️ Inconsistency** - Consistent GUI pattern:
   - [ ] Uniform nomenclature (ed_ for QLineEdit, btn_ for QPushButton)?
   - [ ] Consistent message style?
   - [ ] Consistent layout spacing/margin?

6. **🔗 Lack of Integration** - GUI connected:
   - [ ] Dock added to MainWindow?
   - [ ] Menu item connected to dock.show()?
   - [ ] Custom signals connected?
   - [ ] Import present in app.py?

7. **🧩 Lower Cohesion** - Dock focused:
   - [ ] Dock only does UI (not business logic)?
   - [ ] Complex logic in separate module?
   - [ ] Each method has a single responsibility?

8. **🔗 Higher Coupling** - Decoupled GUI:
   - [ ] Dock does not depend on internal implementation of other docks?
   - [ ] Communication via signals/slots (not direct calls)?
   - [ ] GUI testable independently (mock logic)?

9. **🗑️ Strange Information** - Clean code:
   - [ ] No forgotten `print()` debugs?
   - [ ] No unresolved TODOs?
   - [ ] No unused widgets?

**Example of Applied GUI Review**:
```python
# ❌ BEFORE - Omission, Ambiguity, Higher Coupling
class NewComponent(QDockWidget):
    def __init__(self):
        self.btn = QPushButton("Convert")  # Vague label
        self.btn.clicked.connect(self.convert)  # No error handling
    
    def convert(self):
        data = open(self.ed_file.text()).read()  # No validation, no close
        data_str = my_convert(data)  # Business logic in GUI
        print(data_str)  # Forgotten debug

# ✅ AFTER - Complete, Clear, Decoupled
class NewComponent(BaseDock):
    """Text to DATA Converter dock widget."""
    
    # Signal for communication
    open_in_other_component_requested = Signal(str)
    
    def __init__(self, parent=None):
        super().__init__(parent)
        self._create_widgets()
        self._setup_layout()
        self._connect_signals()
        
        # Controller for business logic
        self._converter = TextToJsonConverter()
    
    def _create_widgets(self):
        """Create UI widgets."""
        self.ed_file = QLineEdit()
        self.ed_file.setPlaceholderText("Enter file path or paste text")
        
        self.btn_convert = QPushButton("Convert to DATA")
        self.btn_convert.setToolTip("Convert text to DATA format")
        
        self.btn_open_component = QPushButton("Open in Editor")
        self.btn_open_component.setEnabled(False)  # Disabled until converted
    
    def _connect_signals(self):
        """Connect signals to slots."""
        self.btn_convert.clicked.connect(self._on_convert_clicked)
        self.btn_open_component.clicked.connect(self._on_open_component_clicked)
    
    def _on_convert_clicked(self):
        """Handle convert button click."""
        file_path = self.ed_file.text().strip()
        
        if not file_path:
            QMessageBox.warning(self, "Empty Input", "Please enter a file path or text.")
            return
        
        try:
            # Read file with context manager (ensures closing)
            if Path(file_path).exists():
                with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                    text = f.read()
            else:
                text = file_path  # Treat as direct text
            
            # Convert using controller (decoupling)
            self._data_result = self._converter.convert(text)
            
            # Visual feedback
            QMessageBox.information(self, "Success", "Conversion successful!")
            self.btn_open_component.setEnabled(True)
        
        except FileNotFoundError:
            QMessageBox.critical(self, "File Not Found", f"File not found: {file_path}")
        except Exception as e:
            QMessageBox.critical(self, "Conversion Error", f"Error: {str(e)}")
    
    def _on_open_component_clicked(self):
        """Handle open in editor button click."""
        if hasattr(self, '_data_result'):
            self.open_in_other_component_requested.emit(self._data_result)  # Signal
```

**Recommended GUI Tools**:
```bash
# Check unused Qt imports
grep -r "from PySide6" src/gui/ | cut -d: -f2 | sort | uniq

# Check unconnected signals (manual review)
grep -r "Signal(" src/gui/ | grep -v ".connect("

# Check unused widgets (manual review)
grep -r "self\.\w\+ = Q" src/gui/

# Check debug prints (CRITICAL)
grep -r "print(" src/gui/ --exclude="*_test.py"
```

**Questions to Validate GUI**:
1. ❓ "Is the dock fully integrated into the menu and MainWindow?"
2. ❓ "Are all signals connected and working?"
3. ❓ "Is there error handling with visual feedback (QMessageBox)?"
4. ❓ "Is business logic separated from GUI code?"
5. ❓ "Is the code free of debug prints and unresolved TODOs?"
6. ❓ "Are labels, tooltips, and messages clear and descriptive?"
7. ❓ "Are resources (files, connections) closed correctly?"

**Real Example (Task Example - Text to DATA Converter)**:
```python
✅ Import: from .gui import NewComponent
✅ Export: __all__ = [..., 'NewComponent']
✅ Menu: self.act_open_new_component.triggered.connect(lambda: self.dock_new_component.show())
✅ Init: self._open_new_component() called in __init__()
✅ Signal: open_in_other_component_requested.connect(self._load_data_from_source)
✅ i18n: EN "Text to DATA Converter", PT-BR "Conversor de Texto para DATA"
✅ Review: No debug prints, error handling OK, decoupled logic
✅ Test: Menu opens dock, conversion works, signal to editor OK
```

### 9️⃣ **Verify Integration with Main Program**
- **CRITICAL**: After implementing CLI and GUI, **verify that everything is integrated and working in the context of the main program**
- It's not enough to have code working in isolation, it needs to be **accessible and operational** in the application
- Check full flow: menu → action → result
- Manually test the functionality in the running program

**Complete Integration Checklist**:

1. **Full GUI Flow Test**:
   ```bash
   # Start application
   python -m app --gui
   
   # Manually test:
   [ ] Does the menu item appear correctly?
   [ ] Does clicking the menu open the dock?
   [ ] Does the dock display all controls?
   [ ] Does basic functionality work (conversion, search, etc)?
   [ ] Do signals between components work (e.g., "Open in Editor")?
   [ ] Do error messages appear when appropriate?
   [ ] Does i18n translation work (change language and verify)?
   ```

2. **Full CLI Flow Test**:
   ```bash
   # Test help
   python -m app convert --help
   
   # Test functionality
   python -m app convert test.txt --pretty -o output.data
   
   # Test pipes
   echo "name: John" | python -m app convert -
   
   # Verify:
   [ ] Does help text appear?
   [ ] Are arguments recognized?
   [ ] Does functionality execute without errors?
   [ ] Is the output correct?
   [ ] Are exit codes correct (0=success, 1=error)?
   ```

3. **Inter-Component Integration Test**:
   ```bash
   # Example: Convert text → Open in editor
   [ ] Does clicking "Open in Editor" in the Text to DATA Converter open the Editor?
   [ ] Is DATA correctly loaded in the Editor?
   [ ] Can the Editor save the result?
   
   # Example: Search → Open file
   [ ] Does clicking a search result open the correct file?
   [ ] Does the cursor position go to the correct line?
   ```

4. **Robustness Test**:
   ```bash
   # Error scenarios
   [ ] Does "File not found" display a clear message?
   [ ] Is invalid input handled gracefully?
   [ ] Does a cancelled operation leave no inconsistent state?
   [ ] Are resources released correctly (files closed, memory)?
   ```

5. **Performance Test** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   # Large files
   [ ] Processes files >10MB without freezing?
   [ ] Interface remains responsive during long operation?
   [ ] Progress bar/visual feedback works?
   [ ] Cancellation works during long operation?
   ```

**Real Example of Integration Problem**:
```python
# ❌ PROBLEM FOUND IN INTEGRATION:
# Task Example - Text to DATA Converter CLI
# Problem: Extractor() was called without 3 mandatory parameters

# BEFORE (broke on integration):
def main():
    if args.command == 'convert':
        extractor = Extractor()  # ❌ TypeError: missing 3 required arguments

# AFTER (fixed):
def main():
    if args.command == 'convert':
        extractor = Extractor(
            avoid_keys="",
            avoid_keys_parameter="equals",
            with_quotation_marks=False
        )  # ✅ Works!
```

**Questions to Validate Integration**:
1. ❓ "Can the end-user easily access the functionality?"
2. ❓ "Do all usage flows work end-to-end?"
3. ❓ "Are there any errors or warnings in the console during normal use?"
4. ❓ "Is the functionality consistent with the rest of the application?"
5. ❓ "Is the documentation (help text, tooltips) clear and correct?"

**Why is this step critical?**:
- ✅ Detects problems that unit tests don't catch
- ✅ Validates real user experience
- ✅ Ensures all work is truly usable
- ✅ Avoids surprises after commit (tested code ≠ integrated code)

---

### 🔟 **Run Tests**
- **Mandatory**: Unit tests for each public function
- **Goal**: 100% coverage of implemented functionalities
- **Tools**: `unittest` (native) or `pytest`
- **CRITICAL**: Test the system **after integration** (integrated GUI + CLI)
- **IMPORTANT**: Execute **AFTER** code review (Steps 7 and 8)

**Test Categories**:
1. **Happy Path**: Normal use cases
2. **Edge Cases**: Empty values, None, long strings
3. **Error Handling**: Expected exceptions
4. **Integration**: Full flow (including GUI/CLI integration)
5. **Quality Validation**: Tests that validate the absence of the 9 problems from Steps 7 and 8

**Example Test Suite**:
```python
✅ test_basic_functionality()
✅ test_with_valid_input()
✅ test_edge_case_empty()
✅ test_edge_case_large_input()
✅ test_error_handling()
✅ test_integration_complete_flow()
# ... tests covering normal cases, edge cases, and integration
```

**Why test AFTER integration and review?**:
- Ensures that tests validate the **integrated system**, not isolated components
- Detects integration problems during tests
- Validates that features actually work in the application context
- Avoids false positives (tests pass but feature is not accessible)
- Code has already been reviewed, so tests validate **quality code**

**Why?**: Ensure quality, avoid regressions, facilitate future maintenance.

---

#### 🛡️ **Step 9.1 - Security in Tests (CRITICAL)**

**Common Problem in Tests**:
- GUI tests can get stuck in an **infinite loop** without timeout
- Lack of automatic deadlock or freeze detection
- Tests wait for unavailable resources (e.g., X11 display in a headless environment)

**Mandatory Solutions**:

1. **⏱️ Mandatory Maximum Timeout** (30s per test):
   ```bash
   # ALWAYS use timeout in tests
   pytest tests/test_*.py --timeout=30 -v
   
   # Install pytest-timeout plugin if necessary
   pip install pytest-timeout
   ```

2. **🚨 Infinite Loop Detection** (warning in 10s):
   ```bash
   # More aggressive timeout to detect loops
   timeout 10s pytest tests/test_specific.py || echo "⚠️ TIMEOUT: Possible infinite loop detected!"
   ```

3. **🖥️ Mandatory Headless Environment** (GUI tests without display):
   ```bash
   # Use Qt offscreen platform
   QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen pytest tests/test_gui_*.py -v --timeout=30
   
   # OR use pytest-xvfb for virtual X11 environment
   pip install pytest-xvfb
   pytest tests/test_gui_*.py --xvfb-backend xvfb --timeout=30
   ```

4. **✅ Mandatory Dry-Run** (before executing):
   ```bash
   # 1. Verify syntax
   python -m py_compile tests/test_*.py && echo "✅ Valid syntax"
   
   # 2. Verify imports
   python -c "from tests.test_module import *; print('✅ Imports OK')"
   
   # 3. List tests without executing
   pytest tests/test_*.py --collect-only
   ```

5. **⏲️ Time Monitoring** (record duration):
   ```bash
   # Measure total time and save log
   time pytest tests/test_*.py -v --timeout=30 | tee test_output.log
   
   # Use pytest-benchmark for metrics
   pytest tests/test_*.py --benchmark-only --timeout=30
   ```

**Why?**: Avoid infinite freezes, protect development time, ensure reliable tests.

---

### 1️⃣1️⃣ **Organize Project Root Folder**
- ✅ Imports validated (module loads without errors)
- 📝 **Documented limitation**: GUI tests require an unconfigured headless environment

---

#### 🔬 **Step 9.2 - Tests in Threads/Processes with Monitoring (ADVANCED)**

**Objective**: Full control over test execution with the possibility to **interrupt**, **monitor**, and **log** progress in real-time.

**When to Use**:
- GUI tests that may freeze
- Long-running tests (>1 min)
- Tests with external dependencies (network, database)
- Need for real-time logging
- Need for manual cancellation during execution

**Implementation with `multiprocessing.Process`**:

```python
# tests/test_runner_monitored.py
import multiprocessing as mp
import time
import sys
from queue import Empty

                elif msg['type'] == 'exit':
                    process.join(timeout=2)
                    elapsed = time.time() - start_time
                    print(f"\n✅ Tests finished in {elapsed:.2f}s")
                    return {
                        'status': 'completed',
                        'exit_code': msg['code'],
                        'elapsed': elapsed,
                        'results': results
                    }
            
            except Empty:
                # No message, continue monitoring
                pass
            
            # Show progress every 10s
            if int(elapsed) % 10 == 0 and int(elapsed) > 0:
                print(f"⏳ Executing... {int(elapsed)}s ({results['passed']} passed, {results['failed']} failed)")
    
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\n⚠️  Manual cancellation (Ctrl+C)")
        process.terminate()
        process.join(timeout=5)
        if process.is_alive():
            process.kill()
        elapsed = time.time() - start_time
        return {'status': 'cancelled', 'elapsed': elapsed, 'results': results}
    
    finally:
        if process.is_alive():
            process.terminate()
            process.join(timeout=5)

# Example usage:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    result = monitor_test_execution('tests/test_advanced_file_search.py', max_timeout=300)
    
    print(f"\n{'='*60}")
    print(f"Status: {result['status']}")
    print(f"Time: {result['elapsed']:.2f}s")
    print(f"Passed: {result['results']['passed']}")
    print(f"Failed: {result['results']['failed']}")
    print(f"{'='*60}")
```

**Practical Use**:

```bash
# 1. Create monitored runner
cat > tests/run_tests_monitored.py << 'EOF'
# [code above]
EOF

# 2. Execute with monitoring
python tests/run_tests_monitored.py

# 3. Cancel at any time (Ctrl+C)
# The process will be terminated gracefully
```

**Advantages**:
- ✅ **Full control**: Can cancel tests at any time
- ✅ **Real-time logging**: See progress of each test
- ✅ **Global + individual timeout**: Double protection
- ✅ **Statistics**: Pass/fail in real time
- ✅ **Isolation**: Tests run in a separate process (don't freeze the terminal)
- ✅ **Guaranteed cleanup**: `terminate()` + forced `kill()` if necessary

**Optional Configurations**:

1. **File Logging** (in addition to stdout):
   ```python
   # Add to run_tests_in_process:
   import logging
   logging.basicConfig(
       filename=f'test_{time.time()}.log',
       level=logging.INFO,
       format='%(asctime)s - %(message)s'
   )
   ```

2. **Sound Notification** (upon completion):
   ```python
   import os
   # At the end of monitor_test_execution:
   os.system('paplay /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/complete.oga')
   ```

3. **CI/CD Integration**:
   ```python
   # Return correct exit code:
   sys.exit(0 if result['status'] == 'completed' and result['results']['failed'] == 0 else 1)
   ```

**Additional Checklist (Step 9.2 - Optional)**:
```
[ ] Create test_runner_monitored.py with multiprocessing
[ ] Define global timeout (default: 5 min)
[ ] Define individual timeout per test (default: 30s)
[ ] Implement real-time logging (Queue)
[ ] Test manual cancellation (Ctrl+C)
[ ] Verify process cleanup (ps aux | grep pytest)
```

**When NOT to use**:
- Simple and fast tests (<10s total)
- Tests without GUI (pure backend)
- CI/CD with native timeout configured
- First execution of tests (unnecessary overhead)

### 1️⃣1️⃣ **Organize Project Root Folder**
- **CRITICAL**: Before documentation and commit, **organize the root folder recursively**
- **MANDATORY**: Files must be organized in the correct folders before commit
- Remove temporary files, unnecessary backups
- Verify all files are in the correct places
- Clear cache and generated files (`__pycache__`, `.pyc`)
- Ensure `.gitignore` is updated

**Organization Checklist**:
1. **Removal of Temporary Files**:
   ```bash
   # Remove old backups
   rm -f *.backup_* *.bak *~
   
   # Clear Python cache
   find . -type d -name "__pycache__" -exec rm -rf {} +
   find . -type f -name "*.pyc" -delete
   find . -type f -name "*.pyo" -delete
   ```

2. **Directory Structure Verification (MANDATORY)**:
   - `src/` - source code
   - `tests/` - **ALL test files** (mandatory)
   - `docs/` - **ALL documents and markdown files** (mandatory)
   - Organized root files (README, setup.py, etc.)

3. **Mandatory Recursive Organization**:
   
   **⚠️ FUNDAMENTAL RULE**: 
   > Before commit, files must be organized in folders recursively. This is **mandatory** to keep the environment clean and organized.

   **Specific Rules by File Type**:
   
   a) **Test Files** → `tests/`
      - ✅ `test_*.py`, `*_test.py` → `tests/`
      - ✅ Test structure should mirror code structure
      - ✅ Example: `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/fixtures/`
   
   b) **Documents and Markdown** → `docs/`
      - ✅ All `.md` files (except root README.md) → `docs/`
      - ✅ Documentation files → `docs/`
      - ✅ **Recursive organization within `docs/`**:
        - `docs/api/` - API documentation
        - `docs/tutorials/` - Tutorials
        - `docs/architecture/` - Architectural decisions
        - `docs/user-guide/` - User guides
        - `docs/dev-guide/` - Development guides
      - ✅ Create subfolders that identify file context
   
   c) **Source Code** → `src/` or appropriate folder
      - ✅ Organize by modules/features
      - ✅ Example: `src/core/`, `src/utils/`, `src/api/`

**Complete Example**:
```bash
# BEFORE (disorganized):
├── src/
├── test_utils.py              ❌ test outside tests/
├── API_DOCS.md                ❌ doc outside docs/
├── tutorial.md                ❌ doc outside docs/
├── apply_v2913_patches.py     ❌ temporary
├── test_temp.py               ❌ temporary test
├── backup_old/                ❌ old backup
├── __pycache__/               ❌ cache
└── file.py.backup_v2913       ❌ unnecessary backup

# AFTER (recursively organized):
├── src/
│   ├── core/
│   └── utils/
├── tests/                     ✅ ALL tests
│   ├── unit/
│   │   └── test_utils.py     ✅ test moved
│   └── integration/
├── docs/                      ✅ ALL documents
│   ├── api/
│   │   └── API_DOCS.md       ✅ doc moved
│   └── tutorials/
│       └── tutorial.md       ✅ doc moved
└── README.md                  ✅ root README kept
```

**Why?**: Keep repository clean, avoid committing junk, facilitate navigation, professionalism, recursive organization ensures scalability. Document the **clean** and **organized** state of the project.

### 1️⃣2️⃣ **Fill in New Documentation**
- **Update tasks/requirements file**: Mark tasks as `[X]` complete
- **Create SPECIFICATIONS.md**: Detailed version document
- **Update statistics**: Project completion percentage
- **🤖 [OPTIONAL] Manage AI task recommendations**

**📋 TASKS.md Management**:

**General Rule**:
- If a tasks/requirements file exists (e.g., `TASKS.md`, `TODO.md`, `requirements.md`):
  - ✅ **Mark tasks as complete** after implementation: `[ ]` → `[X]`
  - ✅ **Update statistics** (percentages, counters)
  - ✅ **Add completion notes** (date, version, brief description)
  - 🤖 **[OPTIONAL] Add new AI-recommended tasks** (see section below)
  
- If a tasks/requirements file **DOES NOT exist**:
  - ❓ **Ask the user** for the file location/path
  - ❓ **Ask about next tasks and requirements** if no formal document exists
  - ❓ **Suggest creating** `TASKS.md` as the default file

---

### 🤖 **AI Task Recommendations (OPTIONAL)**

**When to Use**:
- ✅ After completing implementations or sprints
- ✅ When the project is evolving and can benefit from new functionalities
- ✅ To identify improvement opportunities and refine requirements
- ❌ DO NOT use for disposable projects or temporary prototypes

**Initial Question to User** (ask ONCE at project start):
```
❓ Would you like AI to dynamically recommend new tasks in TASKS.md 
   as the project evolves?
   
Options:
A) ✅ Yes, add recommendations from time to time
B) ❌ No, maintain only tasks I define manually
C) 🔢 Yes, but with a maximum limit of [X] new tasks (default: 30)
```

**If user accepts (option A or C)**:

#### **Recommendation Dynamics (Quadratic Curve)**

AI should follow a recommendation pattern that **grows, reaches a peak, and then decreases**:

```
AI-Recommended Tasks Throughout the Project:

Project Start (0-20% complete):
├── 🟢 PHASE 1: INITIAL GROWTH (0-5 tasks)
│   ├── Recommendations: Few and essential
│   ├── Focus: Establish solid project foundation
│   └── Examples: CI/CD setup, test structure, basic documentation

Early Development (20-40% complete):
├── 🟢 PHASE 2: ACCELERATION (5-15 tasks)
│   ├── Recommendations: Gradually increasing
│   ├── Focus: Main features, important integrations
│   └── Examples: Essential APIs, core features, UX improvements

Mid Development (40-70% complete):
├── 🟡 PHASE 3: MAXIMUM PEAK (15-30 total tasks)
│   ├── Recommendations: Maximum ideas and opportunities
│   ├── Focus: Polishing, secondary features, optimizations
│   └── Examples: Performance tuning, accessibility, i18n, analytics

Late Development (70-90% complete):
├── 🟠 PHASE 4: DECELERATION (10-15 remaining tasks)
│   ├── Recommendations: Decreasing, only critical
│   ├── Focus: Finalization, bugfixes, stability
│   └── Examples: Edge cases, integration tests, final documentation

Final Stage (90-100% complete):
└── 🔴 PHASE 5: EXHAUSTION (0-5 final tasks)
    ├── Recommendations: STOP adding new features
    ├── Focus: Release readiness, final review
    └── Examples: Only critical adjustments or blocking bugfixes
```

**Curve Formula** (for AI implementers):
```
num_recommended_tasks = -4 * (progress - 0.5)² + 30
where:
- progress = completion percentage (0.0 to 1.0)
- num_recommended_tasks = cumulative total of recommended tasks
- Peak maximum at ~50% project completion (30 tasks if default not changed)
```

#### **Limits and Controls**

**Configurable Maximum Limit**:
- 📊 **Default**: 30 new tasks/ideas recommended by AI
- ⚙️ **Configurable**: User can specify another value (e.g., 10, 50, 100)
- 🔢 **Question**: "What is the maximum number of tasks AI can recommend? (default: 30)"

**Scope Control**:
```markdown
### ✅ CRITERIA for AI Recommendations

1. **Within Scope**:
   - ✅ Aligned with project theme/purpose
   - ✅ Based on user feedback (real or simulated)
   - ✅ Improvement of existing requirements
   - ✅ Product professionalism and quality

2. **OUT of Scope** (DO NOT recommend):
   - ❌ Features unrelated to main theme
   - ❌ "Cool but unnecessary" ideas (feature creep)
   - ❌ Unjustified technologies/frameworks
   - ❌ Generic recommendations without project context

3. **Prioritization**:
   - 🔴 MUST HAVE: Critical for the project
   - 🟡 SHOULD HAVE: Important but not blocking
   - 🟢 COULD HAVE: Nice to have, low priority
   - ⚪ WON'T HAVE: Explicitly out of scope
```

#### **Recommendation Format in TASKS.md**

```markdown
## 🤖 AI-Recommended Tasks

_These tasks were suggested by AI based on project progress and 
user feedback. Review and approve before implementing._

---
**📊 AI Recommendation Statistics**:
- Total recommended: 3/30 (10% of limit)
- Current phase: PHASE 2 - ACCELERATION (progress: 35%)
- Next review: After next sprint
```

#### **Addition Frequency**

**When AI should add new tasks**:
- ✅ **After each completed sprint/milestone**
- ✅ **When progress reaches milestones**: 25%, 50%, 75%
- ✅ **When user explicitly requests**: "Suggest new tasks"
- ❌ **NEVER** add tasks in the middle of active implementation

**User Approval**:
```
❓ After each sprint, ask:
"Would you like to review [X] new AI-recommended tasks for TASKS.md?"

A) ✅ Yes, add to TASKS.md for review
B) 📋 Yes, but show preview before adding
C) ⏭️ Skip for now (don't add this sprint)

  - **Effort**: 2 hours

... (9 more tasks)

---
**🎯 Next Recommendation Review**: After Sprint 8 (when reaching 60% progress)
```

#### **Disabling Recommendations**

If user wants to **stop** recommendations:

```markdown
## 🤖 AI Recommendations: DISABLED

_User chose to manage tasks manually._

**To reactivate**: Request AI "Reactivate task recommendations"
```

---

**Why this functionality is valuable?**:
- ✅ **AI Creativity**: Identifies opportunities developers might not see
- ✅ **Professionalism**: Suggests best practices and quality patterns
- ✅ **Refinement**: Collaborates with requirements to meet client expectations
- ✅ **Control**: User has full control (limit, approval, disable)
- ✅ **Focus**: Growth/decay curve prevents feature creep
- ✅ **Scope**: Recommendations based on project context and feedback

**📁 TASKS.md File Location**:
- **Default preference**: The `TASKS.md` file, when created, should be placed in `docs/TASKS.md`
- **Create docs/ folder**: If the `docs/` folder does not exist in the project, it should be created automatically
- **Flexibility**: The user or programmer can choose to place it in another location if preferred
- **Creation example**:
  ```bash
  # Create docs folder if it doesn't exist
  mkdir -p docs
  
  # Create or update TASKS.md
  echo "# Tasks" > docs/TASKS.md
  ```

**Example of Marking (REQUIREMENTS.md)**:
```markdown

## 📊 Practical Application: Task Example (Complete Example)

### Initial Situation
```markdown
Pending tasks in the SHOULD HAVE category:
[ ] Complex Feature Example (VERY COMPLEX)
[ ] Semantic AI Search (VERY COMPLEX)
[⚠️] Feature Update (PARTIAL - simpler!) ✅ CHOSEN
[ ] Google Translate API integration (COMPLEX)
```

### Planned Sprint
```
vX.Y.Z: Complete Task Example
Estimate: 3-4 hours
Complexity: MEDIUM (simpler than the others)
```

### Execution (Simplicity Protocol 1)

**1. Read Documentation** ✅
- Read: `docs/FEATURE_SPEC.md` (662 lines)
- Understood: problem of string similarity vs. value equality

**2. Choose Simple Task** ✅
- Task Example is **simpler** than text editor or AI
- Clear scope: 2 main functions + integration

**3. Ask Questions** ✅
- Asked: "How many words to pick? 3-5?"
- Answer: "Default 30 characters"
- Asked: "Convert to camelCase?"
- Answer: "Yes, remove accents"
- Asked: "Name conflicts?"
- Answer: "Shorter line wins, don't change if values are different"

**4. Sprint** ✅
- 6 subtasks planned (including questions)
- Estimated time: 3h45min

**5. Implement with Architecture** ✅
```
Order executed:
1. extract_all_keys_from_obj() (helper function - High Cohesion)
2. build_substitution_map_by_value() (main function - Low Coupling)
3. Update cli_dedupe() (integration - Dependency Injection)
4. Create tests (validation)
5. Documentation (finalization)

Applied Patterns:
- ✅ Separate modules (Reuse)
- ✅ Type hints in all functions
- ✅ Information Expert (GRASP): each function has the info it needs
- ✅ Low coupling: independent functions
- ✅ High cohesion: each function does ONE thing
```

**6. Run Tests** ✅
```
12 unit tests created:
- 4 tests for extract_all_keys_from_obj()
- 5 tests for build_substitution_map_by_value()
- 2 tests for apply_substitutions_to_file()
- 1 test for update_references_in_project()
Result: 12/12 passing (100%)
```

**7. Documentation** ✅
```
Files created/updated:
- docs/REQUIREMENTS.md (Task Example marked [X])
- docs/FEATURE_SPEC.md (already existed)
- tests/test_reference_updater.py (NEW - 350 lines)
Statistics: 59.6% → 60.6% (63 tasks complete)
```

**8. Commit and Push** ✅
```bash
Commit: 903bca4
Message: 60 lines (complete and detailed)
Status: pushed to GitHub ✅
```

### Final Result
✅ **Task Example 100% complete**
✅ **Simplicity Protocol 1: 10/10 steps met** (v1.1 - 10 steps)
✅ **Actual time: ~3h (within estimate)**
✅ **Zero bugs detected**
✅ **Professional documentation**

**Note**: This example uses v1.1 of the protocol (10 steps). v1.2 adds 2 more steps (GUI and CLI integration).

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### ✅ What Works
1. **Choose the simplest**: Task Example was easier than text editor
2. **Incrementality**: Helper function → main → integration
3. **Tests first**: Detected 2 necessary adjustments before committing
4. **Complete documentation**: Facilitates future maintenance

### ❌ Anti-patterns to Avoid
1. **Don't start with the hardest task**
   - ❌ "I'll do the text editor first (50h)"
   - ✅ "I'll do the tooltip preview first (30min)"

2. **Don't do everything at once**
   - ❌ "I'll implement everything in one giant function"
   - ✅ "I'll split into 3 testable functions"

3. **Don't skip tests**
   - ❌ "I'll test manually later"
   - ✅ "I'll create 12 unit tests now"

4. **Don't make generic commits**
   - ❌ `git commit -m "updates"`
   - ✅ `git commit -m "feat: Task Example with VALUE EQUALITY (60 lines)"`
